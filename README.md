 veadotube plugin shenanigans

hi so i dont really have strong goals here but this is just me messing around with the veadotube api :3

## playground
interfacing w/ the api via javascript w/ an html frontend!
the idea is to mess w/ controlling states from here but for now it just displays stuff ^w^
